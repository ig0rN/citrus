# Custom MVC

## Description

Custom MVC created for 24h with pure PHP which looks like Laravel

System has:
 - Index page ( all products, comments for company & products )
 - Admin login
 - Admin page ( CRUD for products, comments - approve or deny & delete)
 - Flashing messages

## Initial cloning
- Clone project

- Make virtual host for project

- Create database "citrus.sql"

- Import database structure and data from "citrus.sql" file from root directory

- Set database params inside "config/database.php"
    
- Open your terminal and go inside project folder
    * cd /to/project/folder
    
- Run "composer install"

- Go in browser and run project via virtual host alias

- Login: username = citrusTest, password = test123

## Notes
- Focus was on back-end logic

- I provided almost a fully functional MVC framework

- Front-end uses Bootstrap library
