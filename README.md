# Citrus
*Pure PHP project*

*Custom MVC*

## Initial cloning
- Clone project

- Make virtual host for project

- Create database "citrus.sql"

- Import database structure and data from "citrus.sql" file from root directory

- Set database params inside "config/database.php"
    
- Open your terminal and go inside project folder
    * cd /to/project/folder
    
- Run "composer install"

- Go in browser and run project via virtual host alias

- Login: username = citrusTest, password = test123

## Notes
- Focus was on back-end logic

- I provided almost a fully functional MVC framework

- Front-end uses Bootstrap library

- While you looking you will see that I made a many more things beside requirements
